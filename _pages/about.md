I am a second year Data Science Master student ([EIT Master program](https://masterschool.eitdigital.eu/programmes/dsc/)) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology with an interest in Data analysis and Machine Learning. My eventual goal is to pursue a PhD in Computer Science specializing in Machine Learning and Computer Vision. I enjoy working on interesting problems and always look forward to collaborations.
