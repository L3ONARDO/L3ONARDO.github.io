I am a second year Data Science Master student at KTH Royal Institute of Technology with an interest in Data analysis and Machine Learning. My eventual goal is to pursue a PhD in Computer Science specializing in Natural Language Processing. I enjoy working on interesting problems and always look forward to collaborations.
