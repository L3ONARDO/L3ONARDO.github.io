The purpose of the project is to design a basic spell checker
in Java. The program is able to correct misspelled words
in the context of a sentence, but should not alter correct words.
The word belongs to the reference vocabulary, and the word should fit
semantically in the enclosing sentence. The project will consider
lower case text only, without interpunction and a single space
character as white space between words<br />
