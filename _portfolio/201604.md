The objective for the project is to build a computer player for the game of international draughts (checkers game). <br />
Draughts is a two player strategy game played on a 10x10 board
of which only the dark fields are used to initially position 20 white
pieces and 20 black pieces. The players in turn move a piece of their
own color diagonally over the board. The white player starts the
game. Pieces of the opponent may be captured by jumping over
them to an empty field. Finally, the player without any remaining 2
moves looses the game.<br />
