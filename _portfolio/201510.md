The search for casualties of a disaster such as an earthquake or a fire is often at great risk. Working in a damaged building with risk of collapse, the presence of toxic gases and radiation is a dangerous task. A new and more secure means to rescue casualties through the use of robots. The mission of this project is to design a remote controlled "search-and-rescue" vehicle to "save" within a predetermined time as many as possible objects from a specially prepared building.<br />
